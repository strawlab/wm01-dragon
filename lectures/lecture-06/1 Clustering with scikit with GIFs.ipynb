Clustering is the subfield of unsupervised learning that aims to partition unlabelled datasets into consistent groups based on some shared unknown characteristics. All the tools you'll need are in Scikit-Learn, so I'll leave the code to a minimum. Instead, through the medium of GIFs, this tutorial will describe the most common techniques.

    "Based on absolutely no empirical evidence (the threshold for baseless assertions is much lower in blogging than academia), [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) is probably the most popular clustering algorithm of them all. The algorithm itself is relatively simple: Starting with a pre-specified number of cluster centres (which can be distributed randomly or smartly (see `kmeans++`)), each point is initally assigned to its nearest centre. In the next step, for each segment, the centres are moved to the centroid of the clustered points. The points are then  reassigned to their nearest centre. The process is repeated until moving the centres derives little or no improvement (measured by the within cluster sum of squares- the total squared distance between each point and its cluster centre). The alogorithm is concisely illustrated by the GIF below.\n",

Note that, under k-medoids, cluster centroids must correspond to the members of the dataset. Alogorithms in the k-means family are sensitive to the starting position of the cluster centres, as each method converges to local optima, the frequency of which increase in higher dimensions. This issue is illustrated for k-means in the GIF below.\n",

To prevent the alogrithm returning sub-optimal clustering, the kmeans method includes the `n_init` and `method` parameters. The former just reruns the algorithm with n different initialisations and returns the best output (measured by the within cluster sum of squares). By setting the latter to 'kmeans++' (the default), the initial centres are smartly selected (i.e. better than random). This has the additional benefit of decreasing runtime (less steps to reach convergence)."

Similar to k-means, the algorithm converges to the final clustering by iteratively improving its performance (i.e. reducing the log-likelihood).

    "\n",
    "Mean shift describes a [general non-parametric technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_shift) that locates the maxima of density functions, where Mean Shift Clustering simply refers to its application to the task of clustering. In other words, locate the density function maxima (mean shift algorithm) and then assign points to the nearest maxima. In that sense, it shares some similarities with k-means (the density maxima correspond to the centroids in the latter). Interestingly, the number of clusters is not required for its implementation and, as it's density based, it can detect clusters of any shape. Instead, the algorithm relies on a bandwidth parameter, which simply determines the size of neighbourhood over which the density will be computed. A small bandwidth could generate excessive clusters, while a high value could erroneously combine multiple clusters. Luckily, sklearn includes an [estimate_bandwidth function](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.estimate_bandwidth.html). It uses the [k-nearest neighbours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) (kNN) algorithm to determine an optimal bandwidth value. I suppose that makes it even easier than k-means to implement. \n",

    "[Originally invented in 1975](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1055330/), mean shift gained prominence when it was successfully applied to computer vision (seminal paper [#1](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/400568/) [#2](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109%2F34.1000236)). I won't discuss the underlying maths (that info can be found [here](https://saravananthirumuruganathan.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/introduction-to-mean-shift-algorithm/) and [here](http://efavdb.com/mean-shift/)). Intuitively, cluster centers are initially mapped onto the dataset randomly (like k-means). Around each centre is a ball (the radius of which is determined by the bandwidth), where the density equates to the number of points inside each ball. The centre of the ball is iteratively nudged towards regions of higher density by shifting the centre to the mean of the points within the ball (hence the name). This process is repeated until balls exhibit little movement. When multiple balls overlap, the ball containing the most points is preserved. Observations are then clustered according to their ball. Didn't follow that? Well, here's the gif.\n",

First of all, there's no guarantee that the value returned by estimate_bandwidth is appropriate (a caveat that becomes more pertinent in higher dimensions). Speaking of high dimensionality, mean shift may also converge to local optima rather than global optima. But the biggest mark against Mean Shift is its computational expense. It runs at $O(T*n^2)$, compared to $O(k*n*T)$ for k-means, where T is number of iterations and n represents the number of points. In fact, [according to the sklearn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.MeanShift.html#sklearn.cluster.MeanShift), the `estimate_bandwidth` function scales particularly badly.

    "\n",
    "Affinity propagation (AP) describes an algorithm that performs clustering by passing messages between points. It seeks to identify highly representative observations, known as exemplars, where remaining data points are assigned to their nearest exemplar. Like mean-shift, the alogorithm does not require the number of clusters to be prespecified. Instead, the user must input two parameters: preference and damping. Preference determines how likely an observation is to become an exemplar, which in turn decides the number of clusters. In that sense, this parameter somewhat mimics the number of clusters parameter in k-means/EM. The damping parameter restricts the magnitude of change between successive updates. Without this, AP can be prone [to overshooting the solution and non-convergence](http://www.psi.toronto.edu/affinitypropagation/faq.html). Provided convergence is achieved, damping shouldn't significantly affect the output (see last GIF in this section), though it could increase the time to reach convergence.\n",

I'll still provide some GIFs, but a mathematical description might be more informative in this case (i.e. I'm now going to paraphrase the [AP wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_propagation)). AP starts off with a similarity (or affinity) matrix (`S`), where similarity (`s(i,j)`) is often formulated as the distance between points (e.g. negative Euclidean distance). The diagonal of the matrix (`s(i,i)`) is important, as this is where the preference value is inputted. In practice, 'passing messages between points' translates to updating two matrices. The first is the responsibility matrix (`R`), where `r(i,k)` represents the suitability of data point `k` to serve as an exemplar for point `i`. The second matrix is known as the availability matrix (`A`), where `a(i,k)` indicates the appropriateness of point `k` being an exemplar for point `i`, taking into account how well suited `k` is to serve as an exemplar to other points.\n",

    "It's clear that the default settings in the [sklearn implementation of AP](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AffinityPropagation.html) didn't perform very well on the two datasets (in fact, neither execution converged). AP can suffer from non-convergence, though appropriate calibration of the damping parameter can minimise this risk. While AP doesn't explicitly require you to specify the number of clusters, the preference parameter fulfills this role in practice. Playing around with preference values, you'll notice that AP is considerably slower than k-means. That's because AP runtime complexity is O(n^2), where n represents the number of points in the dataset. But it's not all bad news. AP simply requires a similarity/affinity matrix, so the exact spatial position of each point is irrelevant. This also means that the algorithm is relatively insensitive to high dimensional data, assuming your measure of similarity is robust in higher dimensions (not the case for squared Euclidean distance!). Finally, AP is purely deterministic; so there's no need for multiple random restarts á la kmeans. For all of these reasons, [AP outperforms its competitors](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5814/972) in complex computer visions tasks (e.g. clustering human faces)."

    "# DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "[Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) (DBSCAN) is a density based clustering algorithm that can neatly handle noise (the clue is in the name). Clusters are considered zones that are sufficiently dense. Points that lack neighbours do not belong to any cluster and are thus classifed as noise (a state that is not immediately attainable under traditional k-means or HC). DBSCAN doesn't require the user to specify the number of clusters; it works that out for you. Instead, the user must define the minimum number of observations that constitutes a cluster (`minPts`) and the size of the neighbourhoods (epsilon- often denoted as `eps` or $\\epsilon$). In simple terms, DBSCAN identifies clusters and then expands those clusters by scanning the neighbourhoods of the assigned points. Once all neighbourhoods have been exhausted, the process repeats with a new cluster, until all observations belong to a segment or have been classified as noise (see GIF below).\n",

    "![title](https://dashee87.github.io/images/DBSCAN_tutorial.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious advantage of DBSCAN is that the user doesn't need to specify the number of clusters. Also, as already stated, the ability to robustly treat outliers as noise distinguishes it from other techniques. Finally, being density based, DBSCAN can return clusters of any shape."

    "Wow! It managed to correctly segment `Dataset2` without knowing number of clusters beforehand. But before you throw k-means in the bin and get a DBSCAN tattoo ([a google image search returned nothing interesting](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dbscan+tattoo&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbvJWFz_vRAhUBWhoKHTOrCsAQ_AUICCgB&biw=1600&bih=794)), DBSCAN does have its flaws too. In rare cases, border points can flip between clusters, depending on the order by which the data is processed, meaning different executions can return different outputs. Like all clustering techniques discussed in this tutorial, DBSCAN suffers from the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)- distance functions become less meaningful in higher dimensions, as all points are 'far away' from each other. For similar reasons, it can be hard to determine the appropriate values of epsilon and minPts (though trial and error will ususually sffice in 2 dimensions- see below GIF).\n",

    "But these concerns are either minor or not unique to DBSCAN. A much bigger issue arises if the clusters exhibit varying density. In such cases, it may be impossible to find a decent epsilon value, as one single value can't perform well on each cluster. This is where [OPTICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm) (Ordering points to identify the clustering structure) would come in. Unfortunately, OPTICS isn't currently available in Scikit learn, [though there is a nearly 4 year old (active!) pull request open on github](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/1984). There's also an extension of DBSCAN called [HDBSCAN](http://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html) (where the 'H' stands for Hierarchical, as it incorporates HC). [It overcomes some of DBSCAN traditional faults](http://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparing_clustering_algorithms.html). However, it's also currently not included in scikit (though there is an [extensively documented python package on github](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan)). I might discuss these algorithms in a future blog post."

    "You may be wondering which clustering algorithm is the best. Well, the nature of the data will answer that question. For example, a large dataset could preclude computationally intensive algorithms (e.g hierarchical clustering or affinity propagation). Is anything known about the underlying structure (e.g. globular versus non-globular)? Are you looking for a specific number of clusters? Do you need to illustrate your work with a GIF (I'm looking at you, Affinity Propagation)? So, unfortunately, you need to have various algorithms in your toolbox, ready to deploy as the circumstances dicate (or you could just use k-means for everything).\n",
